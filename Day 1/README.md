# Day 1 Description - Andrew Ton

 I reviewed the Java tutorial as requested from the link, https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/learn-java-for-android-development-introduction-to-java--mobile-2604

 I also did a Java practice problem from LeetCode, it's problem description can be found below.
 LeetCode problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/
 
 
 4Sum:

 Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: []

Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 200
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109
